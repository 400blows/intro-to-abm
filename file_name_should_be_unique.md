# Introduction
Evolution refers to any change across generations in the inherited attributions of the population. The principle of evolution is largely studied in biological systems, but similar processes are observed in social systems.

It was Charles Darwin who formulated the basic scientific theory of evolution by means of natural selection. This theory is still the basis for much of biological research. In the more than 150 years since the publication of his famous book On the Origins of Species we have derived many more insights in the biological mechanisms of evolution. For example, DNA was discovered to encoded the important information of life forms that is transmitted from parents to children.

It is beyond the focus of this chapter to have a detailed discussion on evolution. Instead we will consider the basic principles that Darwin proposed and show how these can be used to model evolution in agent-based models.

Darwin observed that (1) populations produce more offspring than will survive, (2) individuals differ in their traits which allow some individuals to have more offspring than others, and (3), individual characteristics are inheritable. This means that the characteristics of agents who have more offspring will get a larger share in the population than the characteristics of agents who have less offspring. This leads to the saying that those who fit the environment better will produce more offspring. It does not mean that these characteristics are better in all circumstances, but at least in the circumstances that led them to get more offspring.

In order to model the evolution of a population we need to have variation, mutation, and selection.
