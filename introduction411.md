# Introduction
In previous chapters the interactions were defined by the environment, agents running around looking for resources, or by random interactions. These models did not include the observation that in real social systems interactions are not random.

Nowadays, many people are part of social network websites like [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/). Members are not connected by a random sample of other members, but they are connected with their “friends.” If we look at the networks in social network websites we will observe a structure. The structure of a network can affect a number of social phenomena, for example, the spread of a rumor. If a well-connected Facebook member puts a rumor on her page, this information will spread much faster among the Facebook community compared to the case in which the same rumor is put on the page of a person who has only one friend.

When we include network structures into our agent-based models we will be able to study the effect of network structure on the diffusion of information, norms, diseases, behavior, etc. We will discuss various applications in the coming chapters. This chapter will discuss the basics of networks.
