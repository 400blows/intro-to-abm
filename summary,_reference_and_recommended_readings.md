##Summary
In this chapter we look at consumer behavior in buying products on the market. Agents aim to buy products to satisfy different needs. In making decisions they use less cognitive energy when satisfied and focus their attention to choices of others when uncertain. The agents use a different heuristic of decision making depending on the agentâ€™s context at that moment.
