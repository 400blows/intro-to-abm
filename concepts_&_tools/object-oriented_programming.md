# Object-oriented Programming
In this course we use NetLogo which is a modeling program specifically designed for agent-based modeling and is developed by using Java. Java is a so-called [object-oriented programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) language. NetLogo provides a user-friendly shell around Java. NetLogo is also an object-oriented programming language. To understand how to read and write programs, we need to discuss briefly what object-oriented programming means.

A program is build up by objects. These objects are little pieces of code that are activated during the simulation. For example, you make a model of ants walking around in an environment searching for food and bringing food back to the nest. Instead of making one long list of commands, you split it up into components such as: how to walk when searching, how to walk back to the nest, how to recognize food, how to drop pheromone, etc. These components are self sustained and can be called upon by different places in the program. In Figure 3 we give an example of a number of objects that are called upon in different places in the program. If the user starts the program, the object in the left top corner will be activated (in NetLogo the objects are called procedures, and the starting procedure is often called “go”). This object will call another object and based on what happens in the object, one of three routes is used. Some objects call themselves. This is an example of recursion.

In your NetLogo models you will see that you first need to activate “setup,” which is a set of calculations to clean up the memory and define the number of agents and cells, and the starting values of the variables. Only when this has happened, the procedure “go” can be activated, which will run the model through various iterations.
