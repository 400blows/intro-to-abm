# The Modeling Process
How do you create a formal model? You don’t start by sitting at a computer writing a program. Rather, it is useful to follow a set of actions that provides you with a more reasoned approach to the model design.

First you need to define the scope of your research. What is the question you want to address? You may brainstorm in a group or by yourself about what the future model needs to be able to do? Is it used to test a specific hypothesis, or is it used as a planning tool in collaboration with stakeholders? Do you want the model to be interactive with visual output, or to run the model many times for many different assumptions?

Suppose you are interested in studying why a movie becomes a hit. The question then becomes how to make a model that can predict whether a movie will become a hit based on the characteristics of that movie. Such a model can be developed from available statistics, and a statistical model seems to be an appropriate approach. However, if one wants to understand the “ecology” of movies, why one movie attracts lots of consumers while a similar movie does not, an agent-based model might be a more suitable approach.

One of the interesting statistics about movies is that most movies derive the highest earnings in their first week. After a few weeks the movie stops attracting viewers. If people go to a movie because they read good reviews of the movie, you would expect that with successful movies there would be an increase in visitors over the weeks. However, this is a rare pattern in the data. In Figure 5 we depict the U.S. returns of two movies that were released in the middle of November 2008. The James Bond movie [Quantum of Solace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_of_Solace) earned half of the total earnings in the first week after its release (82 million dollars). The returns fell rapidly after the first week. This is in contrast to the Oscar-winning movie [Slumdog Millionaire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire) which started with very modest earnings. It gained momentum during the Christmas season and got an extra boost when it was nominated for 10 Oscars. The highest earnings were derived the week after the movie won the Oscar for best motion picture.

The pattern of Slumdog Millionaire is a very rare pattern in movie ecology. Most movies follow the pattern of Quantum of Solace. Most people want to see a movie when it first becomes available. The same phenomenon, highest sales at the moment of release, is also found in other information products like books (consider the sales of the Harry Potter books).

When you get some ideas of what you want to work through you can start to define the components of the model. It is important to “keep it simple, stupid.” So, try to identify only the most important components and processes. What are the agents? What are their attributes and their interaction with other agents and their environment?

For the movie example, one may consider at least individuals as potential moviegoers, movies, and producers of movies as agents. Individuals have a variety of preferences, limited time and resources, friends and family with whom they like to go to the movies, a distance from nearby cinemas, etc. Movies have different characteristics such as genre, actors, and a budget for movie and advertisement. Producers of movies need to make decisions on which kind of movies to produce and when to release them to derive a profit. You can add more and more details such as cinemas, actors, media and advertisement. The challenge is to find the right balance between creating a simple model and having enough content to address the questions you have. This will be an iterative process. You may think you have a simple model, but find out that the results of your model are difficult to understand, and you need to rethink how to simplify it even more.

After these steps, it is time to look at the literature. Have other people studied similar question to the one you want to address? You can use [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/), [“Web of Knowledge,”](http://wokinfo.com/) or look at specific simulation models to find relevant models. If you find a number of useful papers, find out what the pros and cons are of these other papers. What can you learn from these papers? What would you like to do differently? Now you can start to define more precisely the hypotheses you want to explore.

On the movie model there is a substantial literature across different disciplines such as economics (De Vany, 2003), and marketing (Elberse and Eliashberg, 2003). There are also a number of agent-based models developed already such as Delre et al., (2008)

Note that we use a deductive approach in our model design. An inductive approach is possible for social simulation in the following sense. You formulate a number of agents and their interactions and let the model run, observing what happens. Sometimes an explorative approach is used, for example, by changing existing models and adding new processes to explore the consequences. Since the model process that accords the deductive approach is stricter, we will use this approach to discuss the modeling process.

Now you can become more specific on the model components. You may start developing a flow chart of the conceptual model, by which we mean a set of boxes representing variables, and arrows representing relationships. What are the specific attributes of the agents, the cells and other components of the model? What kind of learning model do you like to use? Do the agents derive information without observation error? Etc.

For the movie market model we need to start thinking about the interactions between the individuals, movies and producers (Figure 6). Potential moviegoers can be influenced by advertisements, the attributes of the movie and by the opinions and behaviors of other people in their social network. The producer needs to decide what kind of movie to make, how much to spend on advertisement and when to release it. If the producer has a good portfolio, will it survive the competition? Do producers specialize in certain movies or maintain a wide portfolio? What can explain the fact that after the first week of its release the movie will have attracted the majority of its audience?

Developing flow diagrams leads to a detailed plan of action, and you can finally start the coding of the model. What platform do you want to use? The choice of platform depends on you and your collaborators’ familiarity with the platform, the technical requirements of your model (visualization, connection with Geographic Information Systems), and the audience (students, stakeholders, other scientists). When you have decided on the platform, it is useful to see if there are models available that use similar processes as your model. You can use such a model as your starting point. When you have implemented the model, it is important to test the code (verification). For example, you simulate situations for which you know the result, and confirm that your model produces the correct results.

When you have coded the model, it is important to write down the model specification on paper, including all the assumptions, relevant literature and parameter values you are using. This will be important when you start writing a paper about your model analysis later.

The main use of a computational model is the analysis of its behavior for different assumptions. In a mathematical model we can describe frequently the behavior of the system in closed form. This means that just a few equations describe all the possible situations of the system. This is not possible with simulation models. We can implement the behavior of a number of agents with just a few rules, but to understand what the consequences are we have to do simulations for quite a number of different parameter settings. We need to do a sufficient number of simulations to get a good grasp of the behavior of the system. We will discuss later how to use statistical tools to describe how many simulations and ways there are to explore the parameter space.
