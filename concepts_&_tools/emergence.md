# Emergence

[Emergence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) is a macro-level phenomenon, like the functioning of an ant colony, as a result of local-level interactions. Like the cartoon in Figure 2, understanding of macro level phenomena can only be derived by studying the consequences of the behavior of micro level agents.

Other examples of emergence are:

* #### Path Formation
Paved paths are not always the most desirable routes going from point A to point B. This may lead pedestrians to take short-cuts. Initially pedestrians walk over green grass. Subsequent people tend to use the stamped grass path instead of the pristine grass, and after many pedestrians an unpaved path is formed without any top-down design.

Look around at your campus and you will find examples of paths that have emerged from a bottom-up design (see example of Figure 3).

* ####  Traffic Jams
Have you ever been stuck in a traffic jam only to reach the front of the slow-down to discover that there was no obvious reason for it? Sometimes it happens that traffic jams, defined by slow moving cars, develop rapidly in the opposite direction of the flow of traffic. As a consequence you may enter in a traffic jam that was formed many miles ahead. Traffic jams can also form without direct causes like accidents. When drivers have different preferred speed levels, they need to slow down as they approach a slower car in front of them. As a consequence other cars behind this car will need to slow down too. As we will see in later chapters, we can simulate the emergence of traffic jams by simply assuming differences in the desired speed of the drivers.


* #### Mexican Waves and Standing Ovations
In a Mexican wave people stand up and sit down from their seats in succession, creating a human wave. In a standing ovation people stand up to applaud the performance at the end of an excellent play. Both are examples of emergence in stadiums and theaters. No single individual in the audience is able to create a Mexican wave or a standing ovation. So, how do they emerge? When a few people start others may follow. How many need to start to trigger a wave and does it matter where they are sitting?

* ####     Flocking Behavior
A flock of birds or a school of fish seems to move in unity (as in Figure 2) but no single fish or bird is controlling or directing the group. What individual behaviors can lead to this flocking behavior?


These emergent phenomena can be studied by [complex adaptive systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system). With complex adaptive systems we refer to a group of (locally) interacting agents, who constant act and react to actions of other agents. The coherent emergent behavior that might occur in a system arises from the local interactions of the agents. In the case of a school of fish, we can explain the flocking behavior as a result of a few simple rules such as avoiding local crowding, steering toward the average heading of local fishes, and steering toward the average position of local fishes.

Other examples of complex adaptive systems are:

* **stock markets:** Many traders make decisions on the information known to them and their individual expectations about future movements of the market. They may start selling when they see the prices are going down (because other traders are selling). Such herding behavior can lead to high volatility on stock markets.

* ** immune systems:** Immune systems consist of various mechanisms, including a large population of lymphocytes that detect and destroy pathogens and other intruders in the body. The immune systems needs to be able to detect new pathogens for the host to survive and therefore needs to be able to adapt.

*  **brains:** The neural system in the brain consists of many neurons that are exchanging information. The interactions of many neurons make it possible for me to write this sentence and ponder the meaning of life.

*   **  ecosystems:** Ecosystems consist of many species that interact by eating other species, distributing nutrients, and pollinating plants. Ecosystems can be seen as complex food webs that are able to cope with changes in the number of certain species, and adapt – to a certain extent – to changes in climate.

*    ** human societies:** When you buy this new iPhone that is manufactured in China, with materials derived from African soils, and with software developed by programmers from India, you need to realize that those actions are made by autonomous organizations, firms and individuals. These many individual actions are guided by rules and agreements we have developed, but there is no ruler who can control these interactions.


Complex adaptive systems and emergence are determined by what we call bottom up processes. The opposite would be a system of top-down control. In a top-down controlled system all individual components obey the rules of a central commander or a blue print. Examples are armies and bureaucratic organizations, which are trained to execute orders from higher echelons. They have precise instructions on what to do in order to meet the goals of the organization as a whole. Taking individual initiatives are not appreciated since it may disrupt the well-trained order in the system.
