# Summary & Suggested Readings
Summary
Complex adaptive systems are systems that are defined by a group of (locally) interacting agents, who constant act and react to actions of other agents. Examples of such systems are ant-colonies, immune systems, ecosystems, financial markets, etc.

One of the phenomena of complex adaptive systems is the occurrence of emergence, which is a macro-level phenomenon as a result of local-level interactions. Examples are ant-trails, immune system response to a virus, flocking behavior of birds and bubbles in financial markets.

One of the mechanisms in complex adaptive systems that can cause emergent phenomena is stigmergy. Individuals change the environment, which, in turn, affects the behavior of other individuals.

In this course we will use agent-based models to study complex adaptive systems. We will also use computer simulation to find out how simple rules of local interactions of agents lead to emergent phenomena.
