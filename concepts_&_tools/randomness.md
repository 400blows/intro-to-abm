# Randomness
##Key Concepts
In this chapter you will:
- Learn how to generate random numbers in NetLogo
- Experience the difference between random updating and updating in a fixed order
- Learn to use Behavior Space.

##Introduction
In Chapter 3 we discussed how random numbers in computer programs are generated by a deterministic function. In this chapter we will look in detail at various examples of randomness in NetLogo, how to implement this in NetLogo and what the consequences are of different distributions.
