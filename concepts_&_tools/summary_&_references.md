##Summary
Models are simplifications of real systems, and to simplify we have to make assumptions. There are different ways to make these assumptions, and such decisions are made based on the training and discipline of the modeler. Models should not be seen as holy grails that predict the future but as tools to systematically explore different assumptions.
