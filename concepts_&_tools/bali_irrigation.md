An interesting example of emergence and complex adaptive systems in social systems is irrigation in Bali, Indonesia. Farmers who irrigate their fields in Bali have to solve a complex coordination problem that emerges at the intersection of two separate issues: pest outbreaks and water shortage. On one hand, control of pests is most effective when all rice fields in a watershed have the same schedule of planting rice. The reason is that rice is harvested at the same time and no food for the pests exists in a larger area to survive. If harvest of rice was in small fields only, pest can survive after a harvest by moving to a neighboring field where rice is still on the field. On the other hand, the terraces are hydrologically interdependent, with long and fragile systems of tunnels, canals, and aqueducts. Therefore, to avoid water shortage, the irrigators should not plant rice all at the same time.

To balance the need for coordinated fallow periods and use of water, a complex ritual system has been developed that details what rituals and actions should be done on each specific date in each organized group of farmersâ€”called a [subak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subak_%28irrigation%29). These actions are related to offerings at temples, ranging from the little temples at the rice terrace level to the temples at the regional level and all the way up to the temple of the high priest Jero Gde, the human representative of the Goddess of the Temple of the Crater Lake. Crater Lake feeds the groundwater system, which is the main source of water for irrigating in the entire watershed. These offerings were collected as a counter gift for the use of water that belonged to the gods.

There is no person who has control over the whole irrigation system. At the temple level, subak leaders come together regularly to exchange information on their irrigation experiences in their subaks. When a particular subak makes a decision that has unfavorable effects on neighboring subaks, leaders of the local temple community come together to discuss these matters. This may lead to various actions, including the threat of cutting-off the water supply to the disrupting subak. When seasonal rainfall is different than expected, subaks leaders may come together to discuss alternative cropping pattern to avoid unfavorable circumstances.

The function and power of the water temples were invisible to the planners involved in promoting the [Green Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution) during the 1960s. They regarded agriculture as a purely technical process. Farmers were forced to switch to the miracle rice varieties, which were predicted to lead to three harvests a year, instead of the two harvests of traditional varieties. Farmers were motivated by governmental programs that subsidized the use of fertilizers and pesticides. After the governmental incentive program was started, the farmers continued performing their water temple rituals, but they no longer coincided with the timing of rice-farming activities. Soon after the introduction of the miracle rice, a plague of plant-hoppers caused huge damage to the rice crop. A new variety was introduced, but then a new pest plague hit the farmers. Furthermore, there were problems of water shortage.

During the 1980s, an increasing number of farmers wanted to switch back to the old system, but the engineers interpreted this as religious conservatism and resistance to change. It was anthropologist [Steve Lansing](http://www.santafe.edu/about/people/profile/Steve%20Lansing) who unraveled the function of the water temples, and was able to convince the financers of the Green Revolution project on Bali that the irrigation was best coordinated at the level of the subaks with their water temples. Lansing built an agent-based model of the interactions of subak management strategies and the ecosystem, and the local adaptation of subaks to strategies of neighboring subaks, and showed that for different levels of coordination, from farmer level up to central control, the temple level was the level of scale where decisions could be made to maximize the production of rice. He also showed how the coordination might have been evolved as a result of local interactions. In his agent-based model, agents, representing subaks, make a decision at the end of the year which cropping pattern to use for the next year. They will look at their neighboring subaks to determine whether one of them is doing better than themselves. If this is the case, the subak copies the strategy of the better performing subak. Within a few years, the average simulated yield increases to a level that is close to the maximum yield. The result is that there are pockets of subaks who have the same cropping pattern, solving the pest problem. These pockets of subaks are small enough to avoid serious water shortages. Steve Lansing therefore shows that a complex irrigation network is able to organize themselves by pure local interactions.
