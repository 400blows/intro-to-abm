# The Art of Programming
Programming can be a time consuming and frustrating process. Especially in the beginning the program never seems to do what you intended it to do. By practicing regularly you see that you make common mistakes (typos, forgetting a bracket [ ], etc.) and learn to debug your code better over time.


If you want to make a new program it will help to follow some best practices. It is important not to start programming immediately. First define the program and outline it in words or in a drawing. Once you have identified what components need to be included, then you can write your model in [pseudo code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode), which is a high-level description of your model. Once you have completed these steps, then you can start programming. If possible start with some component that you can test before you add another component. By the end of this process, your program should be work as you intend it to. A common understanding among programmers is that there are no programs without errors. Therefore it will be helpful to do a number of tests, such as running conditions for which you know the answer to see whether your model is accurate. You can also let somebody else work with your model. Another way to check you model is to write a clear documentation.
