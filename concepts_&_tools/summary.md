# Summary
In this chapter we introduced some concepts that will we use during the rest of the course. Computer programs consist of algorithms. Algorithms are a set of commands you give to the computer. Computer programs are very strict since the commands are taken literally. It will take practice to learn to program. That is why we will do so many exercises in the coming weeks.
