# Deductive and Inductive Reasoning
An important topic in understanding different ways we derive knowledge is the difference between inductive reasoning versus deductive reasoning. With inductive reasoning we refer to a process where the starting point is the observation of a phenomenon. Specific patterns and regularities might be found leading to some tentative hypotheses. In the end these hypotheses may become the basis of more generalized theories. Such an approach is called a “bottom-up” approach. For example, an ethnographer observes a tribe in the Amazon for a number of years and finds certain patterns. Later she may compare her findings with other hunter-gather communities, which may lead to a more generalized theory.

###`Observation → pattern → tentative hypothesis → theory`

Many social and life scientists use the inductive approach. It focuses on observation in situations where one does not know what to look for. A trained social and life scientist can observe interesting and surprising behaviors that need explanation.

The deductive reasoning approach follows the opposite direction. One starts with a theory about the topic of interest, and defines hypotheses in order to test the theory. Controlled experiments may be defined and executed so that one can derive observations that one can compare with the predicted behavior. This may lead to confirmation or falsification of the original theory. An example of deductive reasoning is seen with an experimental social scientist who tests the prediction that humans will take into account the welfare of others in making decisions. An experiment is developed to test the theory in a controlled setting where the subjects have to make decisions. The results may confirm or falsify the original theory, and one can compare which theories best explain the observations.

###`Theory → hypothesis → observation → confirmation`

Both approaches are equally valid methods of deriving knowledge although some disciplines are focused on induction (anthropology) while others are focused more on deduction (economics). It is very reasonable to assume one needs to use both approaches to understand complex social processes.

Also from a modeling perspective we can observe the two different approaches. Some scholars develop models that have a certain data set taken from a case study as their starting point. One first derives statistics from the empirical case and then develops a model that may fit the data. When they have developed a model that fits the observations, this model may serve as the first step toward a theory that one can test in future case studies. The Bali irrigation case of chapter one is an example of this approach.

The other approaches start with a general abstract model using rules based on existing rules. The question being asked with this kind of approach is what kind of patterns will evolve when the model is run. Sometimes we derive new insights by testing existing theories, or adjustments of existing theories, in new contexts as we can do with simulation models. For example, Thomas Schelling showed with a model of pennies and dimes that segregation of groups was possible even if agents were tolerant of living among agents of the other type. In the social sciences component of the NetLogo library you find a model of segregation based on [Thomas Schelling's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling) pencil and paper model. Red and green agents are randomly placed on empty cells of the screen. Not all cells will be occupied which makes it possible for agents to move to another empty cell. The idea derived from the model is as follows. Agents are happy to stay in the cell they are in if at least a fraction Tmin of the agents in the eight surrounding cells are of the same color. Hence, the agents still tolerate agents of a different color, but may not want to be completely isolated from their own color. If an agent is not happy, it will move to a nearby empty cell, which is randomly drawn. The model starts with agents randomly placed on the screen. Every time step all agents evaluate in a random order their situation, and the model stops until all agents are satisfied.

The surprising finding of this model is that agents who tolerate diversity starts to become segregated. In Figure 3 we see an example with Tmin equal to 50%. At the end of the simulation 86% of the neighbors of agents have the same color.

This model shows possible mechanisms that can explain observed segregation in the real world. Segregation is possible without a planned discrimination of certain agent types. It is not proof that actual segregation happens in this way. The model points to certain questions researchers may want to take into account when they do study segregation. Can you point to some limitation of the model that may affect the insights that it derives?
