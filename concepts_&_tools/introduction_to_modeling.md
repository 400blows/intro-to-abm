# Introduction to Modeling

##Key Concepts

In the chapter you will
- Get an introduction to models and modeling
- Learn that models are a simplification of reality
- Notice that there are different ways to simplify reality in a meaningful way
- See that you have to make assumptions, but that you will be able to test the effects of assumptions you make.

##Introduction
In this chapter many concepts are discussed that might not be familiar to you. We will have some philosophical discussions on how we know what we know and how there are different ways of knowing. By the end of the chapter you may not understand all the concepts, but in the weeks to come you will recognize some of the concepts we discuss. In fact, one of the main principles of learning to model is to do modeling, to struggle with the process and thereby learn how to do it better. Although modeling is a scientific method, to do modeling is sometimes an art.
