- See that the order in which you give commands to a computer matters

##Introduction

A computer is basically a large number of electric switches that are either turned on or off. To program a computer we have to develop a way to communicate in binary code: 0 and 1. Computer languages like Java (link is external) or C++ (link is external) do this kind of translation for you. Nevertheless, it is helpful to know that a computer is just a large number of on/off statements. In order to get the computer to do what you want you have to be precise in the commands you give it.

This chapter provides a background to programming before we focus on NetLogo, the programming platform used in this book, in the next chapter.
