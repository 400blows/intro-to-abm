# Epistemology: From Ideas to a Conceptual Model
[Epistemology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) is a branch of philosophy that deals with knowing and the methods of obtaining knowledge. What we consider in this chapter are the different ways that scholars reason about their topics of interest as far as this is relevant for agent-based modeling. Since agent-based modeling, like other modeling approaches in social simulation, combines knowledge, insights and tools from various disciplines, it is important to understand that disciplines differ in how they derive knowledge.
