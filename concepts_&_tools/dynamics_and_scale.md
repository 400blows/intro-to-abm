# Dynamics and Scale
The two hardest concepts in social science, maybe science in general, are dynamics and scale. In fact, we don’t even have very clear descriptions of these concepts. If we look at a car, we can measure the speed of the car. In the world of Newtonian mechanics and objects that follow the laws Newton discovered, we can measure speed and acceleration with high accuracy. But in social systems change happens in people’s minds. The change of beliefs, expectations, understandings or preferences all affect our decision making. Such changes can only be measured indirectly, for example via experiments and surveys. It does not help that our subjects of interest, in contrast to the atoms of Newton, reflect on their behavior. If we ask the same person to fill in the same survey one week apart, we likely get differences in responses, even if the respondent is filling in the survey truthfully.

What we can measure are census of citizens, sales statistics, email patterns, traffic flows, etc. as indirect information about the decisions people make. Using statistical models we can make predictions if people continue the behavior they did in the past. Statistical models cannot well capture what happens if behavior is changing. For example, will people react to information about a possible new pandemic in the same way they reacted to the news of the most recent Swine flu (link is external)? In many models in social simulation we describe the decision process itself. This makes it possible to capture a larger diversity of behavior. We would be able to predict the future better if people did not change their behavior. Statistical models are superior for doing just that. But humans are able to anticipate possible behavior and change their behavior, making statistical models obsolete during periods of change. For social simulation scholars studying financial markets the recent economic crisis was not a surprise since they had observed that type of behavior—herding of decision makers leading to bubbles in markets—regularly in their simulation models.

Another question to consider when we study social systems is at what level do we describe the entities of the system? One can look at individuals, couples, families, firms, organizations, communities, nations, etc. Although these seem clear categories, in practice boundaries can be fluid.
For all these levels we can look at entities that interact with each other. Of course actual systems consist of entities at different scales of organization. To make it more complicated, a person might be a member of a family, a firm, an organization, a community and a nation, and have different roles within those entities. Suppose with two persons A and B, person A might be the chairperson of a sport organization in which person B participates, but person B is persons A’s boss in a firm.

Studying social systems is complicated since it is difficult to follow the changing behavior of a system at different levels of scale. When we develop models we will sometimes consider different scales, such as individuals and firms, but it will be a challenge to make models that include agents of different levels of scale.
