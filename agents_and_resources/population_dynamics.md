# Population Dynamics
##Key concepts
In this chapter we will:

*  Introduce torus landscapes and carrying capacity.
*  Present a model where agents are born and die.
*  Demonstrate factors that restrict the size of the population in a landscape.
*  Show a phase diagram to present model results.
*  Introduce primitives `die` and `hatch.`
