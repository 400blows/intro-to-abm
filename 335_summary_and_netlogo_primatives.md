# Summary and NetLogo Primatives
##Summary
In this chapter we showed how to model the basic principles of evolution through the creation of variety in the population, selection of agents and inheritable traits. We also introduced a number of primitives such as agents having a cone vision and interacting with the model via a mouse.
