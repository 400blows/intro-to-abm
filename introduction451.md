# Introduction
Our global society is facing major challenges due to human activities. Human-induced climate change; acidification of land and oceans; loss of biodiversity (link is external); depletion of ground water, fish stocks, or forests, etc., are all major problems that require collective action in order to limit the magnitude of their effects. Besides the destruction of our environment we are also facing major global health challenges. Due to increased transportation of goods and humans, diseases can spread rapidly around the world making us vulnerable to new infectious diseases. Furthermore, almost 2 billion people lack access to proper sanitation, leading to the deaths of millions of people each year due to [diarrhea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea). Collective action is needed to address these global health problems as well.

So the solution to many of the major problems of society requires collective action. But will you give up your holiday to reduce the impact on the environment in the future? Would you be willing to clean toilets to improve sanitation quality? Most people would rather free ride on the efforts of others. This is the [social dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_dilemma).

Coordinated action at the global level might be needed. But global negotiations such as the [Rio + 20 conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Sustainable_Development) in 2012 did not lead to the kinds of concrete shifts in behavioral patterns that are needed for a more sustainable future.

What do we know about collective action? In Chapter 3.4 we discussed the work of Elinor Ostrom who found that in the right conditions communities are able to govern their own common resources. Such conditions include the ability to influence the rules community members have to comply with, graduated sanctioning, and inexpensive conflict resolution mechanisms.

From experimental studies we have gained some additional insights. Most people are willing to cooperate but this willingness is conditional based on the actions of others. Most people will cooperate if others do too. Psychologists have done experiments that show that information about the actions of others can increase cooperation. For example, take the case of towels in hotel rooms. You may have recently seen little cards in hotel bathrooms encouraging patrons to reuse their towels to save energy and water and to help the environment. Psychologist [Robert Cialdini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini) and his colleagues did experiments where they changed the message in half of the hotel rooms to say that 70% of the people in the hotel recycle their towels. This was truthful information, but it was in the rooms with the message that the higher levels of recycling occurred.

In this chapter we discuss some models to study collective action and how assumptions of conditional cooperation and the structure of interaction among agents affect the ability of groups to come to collective action.
