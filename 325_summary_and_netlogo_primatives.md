# Summary and NetLogo Primatives
##Summary
In this chapter we looked at foraging behavior of agents in looking for food resources. We introduced new primitives like `list,` `face` and `breed.` We see that it benefits agents to use memory, but only when food items do not change locations every time they are consumed.
