# Summary and NetLogo Primitives
##Summary
In this chapter we discussed the SIR model to simulate the spread of infectious diseases. We see that the spread of the agents is affected by the average degree of agents and probability of infection and recovery. We have seen that isolating highly connected nodes dramatically reduces the spread of the disease. Hence it is advisable to close schools and other places where people interact with many others in order to stop the spread of the disease.
